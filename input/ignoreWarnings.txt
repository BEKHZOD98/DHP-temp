# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
# See https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig/blob/master/input/ignoreWarnings.txt for examples

# This recommendation does not apply to these examples as they are not clinical observations.
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# IG Publisher can't process ISO 3166 validation just yet - known issue, reported
Error from https://tx.fhir.org/r5: Unable to provide support for code system https://terminology.medcore.uz/CodeSystem/iso3166-two-letter-cs 

# IG Publisher error for additional bindings - known issue, reported
A definition for CodeSystem 'http://medcore.uz/StructureDefinition/uz-core-socioeconomic-observation' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated

# No R5 DICOM package exists yet, but we have to depend on it for our DICOM supplement to resolve correctly - known issue, reported
This IG is version 5.0.0, while the IG 'fhir.dicom' is from version 4.0.1 
The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 5.0.0 but package fhir.dicom#2025.2.20250411 is based on FHIR version 4.0.1. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try
